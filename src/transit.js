    "Description": "Potential outcomes based on Transiting Jupiter and Transiting Saturn influencing Natal Planets according to Bhrigu Nandi Nadi (BNN) principles presented in the sources. Note: These are general potential outcomes when influence occurs; determining *if* influence occurs requires comparing current transit positions to individual natal chart positions based on rules (same rashi, aspects, trines, 3/11 houses). The keys within 'JupiterTransits' and 'SaturnTransits' refer to the *natal* planet being influenced by the transiting planet.",
